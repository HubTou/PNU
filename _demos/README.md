3. Logging module usage (TO BE DONE)
4. Command line options processing (TO BE DONE)
5. Environment variables processing (TO BE DONE)
6. Configuration file processing (TO BE DONE)
7. Writing a script to test the new command against the installed one (TO BE DONE)

You can also check our [echobox](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU/tree/main/echobox) program for an example covering the steps 1 to 5, but I've been told that it's too complicated, thus this step-by-step guides...

The handy [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) online documentation and the online book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) could also be useful to progress quickly.
