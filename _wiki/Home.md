PNU, as in [PNU is Not Unix](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/recursive-acronym.html), is a challenge project and a learning exercise to reimplement [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) command-line tools in [Python](https://www.python.org/), forming a kind of "[pytnix](https://github.com/HubTou/pytnix)" portable user-land utilities collection.

It's meant to be pronounced "Pneu" (tyre in French), a "pun" which seems appropriate as it's clearly another reinvention of the [wheel](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/wheel.html), longtime after the [GNU project](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html) :-)
