# PNU / PyNIX
The PNU Project (PNU as in "PNU is Not Unix"):

(Yet another collection of) UNIX tools rewritten in Python, a kind of PyNIX.

Objectives:
- Firstly intended as a learning exercise in Python/Unix for my son
- Eventually having some handy portable Unix tools, for example for Windows

Project status:
- This is a placeholder for publishing unix tools rewrites made by or with my son
