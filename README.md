# pynix
The PNU Project (PNu as in "Pynix is Not Unix"):
(Yet another collection of) uNIX tools rewritten in Python

Objectives:
- Firstly intended as a learning exercise in Python/Unix for my son
- Eventually having some handy portable Unix tools, for example for Windows

Project status:
- This is a placeholder for publishing unix tools rewrites made by or with my son
