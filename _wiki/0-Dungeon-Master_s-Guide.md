Well there's not that much to do, but here are some things you can do as an organizer:
* Write [test files](https://github.com/HubTou/b2bt/blob/main/README.5.md) for the Unix commands, especially the entry level ones.
  * There are already some examples [there](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU/tree/main/tests).
* Help players in the [discussions](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU/discussions):
  * Don't do (code) it for them, teach them and leave them the fun and joy of discovery!
    >> Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime

    And perhaps, one day, they'll say:
    >> [So long, and thanks for all the fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Long,_and_Thanks_for_All_the_Fish)!
* Promote the project.
* Organize [hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) for the project.
* Help [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_curation) the web site contents.
  * Peculiarly, help with the classification of Unix commands in [difficulty levels](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU/discussions/2)
* etc.

You are welcome, of course, to add other ideas :-)

If you are a computer science teacher, especially for high school students with discovery courses in computer science, feel free to contact us or [discuss](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU/discussions) possible things to do together. The [b2bt](https://github.com/HubTou/b2bt) command might prove useful to guide your students to a successful command-line-tool reimplementation.
